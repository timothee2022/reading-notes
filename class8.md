# My Reading Notes

## JavaScript's expressions and operators:

### 1. Operators

It includes assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical, string, ternary and more operators

* Assignment operators: 
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand
Example: x = f()

* Comparison operators:
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.

* Arithmetic operators:
An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. The standard arithmetic operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

* Logical operators:
Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value.

* Conditional (ternary) operator:
The conditional operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands.

* Comma operator:
The comma operator (,) evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operand. This operator is primarily used inside a for loop, to allow multiple variables to be updated each time through the loop.


### 2. Expressions
An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.
Every syntactically valid expression resolves to some value but conceptually, there are two types of expressions: with side effects (for example: those that assign value to a variable) and those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to a value.

* Primary expressions
Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript.

* Left-hand-side expressions
Left values are the destination of an assignment.


## Loops and iteration

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.
