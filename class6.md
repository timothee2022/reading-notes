# Class 6 reading notes

1. JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, compiled programming language with first-class functions. 
The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402).

2. JavaScript data type: String, Number, Boolean

3. Javascript is more about interactivity on your page

4. I also learn about Input Output in plain JavaScript and JavaScript Variables.

5. A JavaScript variables hold data and can changed depending on the result you are expecting.

6. There are 4 ways to declare a JavaScript Variable (declare value to):

* Using var: declarations, wherever they occur, are processed before any code is executed. 
This is called hoisting. The scope of a variable declared is global
* Using let: allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used, unlike the var keyword.
* Using const: are block-scoped, much like variables defined using the let keyword. 
The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment, and it can't be redeclared.
* Using nothing: Declares a function with the specified parameters.
