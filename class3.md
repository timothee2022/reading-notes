# My Class3 Reading Notes

## Seeing your Remotes

I have learned how to view my remote using couple codes.

### git remote:
This command view the short name, such as origin of all specified remote handles

### git remote -v
This command view all remote URLs next to their corresponding short names

Some examples were given to illustrate the codes.
