# My Reading Notes (Class 102d40 notes)

## Little bit about myself

Hello, thank you for visiting my page. My name is Timothee Odushina. I am a U.S. Army veteran with over 7 years of Active Duty service as an Automated Logistical Specialist (92A). I have background in supply logistis, army aviation maintenance logitics, ground maintenance logistics and warehouse management experience. I am currently a Software Developper student at Codefellows and I am very exited to learn some new skills. I love challenging myself and that is one of the reason I decided to switch to the Tech career. I will be using Windows 10 system during the whole courses. I currently live in El Paso, Texas and I love spending time with my family.

Growth mindset is freedom. Effort is required to build new skills. You strive in challenge and only see the positive way of things. Here are my favorite growth mindset I strive to use at all time:

1. Anything is achievable when you put your mind and work into it.
2. Help yourself first before helping others.
3. Never make fun of someone, you may later be going throught the same things.
