# My Reading Notes (Class 102d40 notes)

## Little bit about myself

Hello, thank you for visiting my page. My name is Timothee Odushina. I am a U.S. Army veteran with over 7 years of Active Duty service as an Automated Logistical Specialist (92A). I have background in supply logistis, army aviation maintenance logitics, ground maintenance logistics and warehouse management experience. I am currently a Software Developper student at Codefellows and I am very exited to learn some new skills. I love challenging myself and that is one of the reason I decided to switch to the Tech career. I will be using Windows 10 system during the whole courses. I currently live in El Paso, Texas and I love spending time with my family.
